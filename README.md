Your new repository is currently empty, so the main branch hasn't been created yet.  
Here's what to do next:

**Quick Solution:**
1. Go to your new repository on GitHub.
2. Click “Add file” → “Create new file”.
3. Name it `README.md`.
4. Paste the profile README content below.
5. Commit the new file (this will create the main branch automatically).

After this, I’ll be able to update your README or make further changes for you!
